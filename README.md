# master_script_primers

A quick and dirty guide for those working with next-gen sequencing (NGS) data and would like to create master shell scripts to automate various jobs in a server cluster.
These primers assume that you have some prior knowledge of bash and server cluster commands, various file formats and tools associated with NGS. 


##### By no means are any of these scripts optimized and complete, they have simply been written to fulfill their job and are hopefully easy enough to understand given the typical experiment set-up and subsequent analysis.
